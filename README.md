Hi it's Ness, the creator of this little storybook game, thing.

If you are interested in continuing the story, stay tuned on my github page!

Sooner or later, a completed copy of the Timespace Chronicals will be posted, and will be compiled for most pc OSes.

The current amount of endings (including this one) are 3!

Try to find 'em all!
