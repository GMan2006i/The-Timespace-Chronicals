The pen is a glories 5 and a half inches long, with a sleek comfortable design.

The tip is a carefully crafted ballpoint with lots of ink.

The pen was also designed not to bleed at all, even the thinest of paper will bleed from the pen.

And despite the no-bleed design, the pen leaves a perfect and stable ink trail when using it, as if a robot printed it's strokes.

This pen is perfect.
You get lost in the craftsmenship.

Staring at this pen makes you feel more complete.
