You quickly hide behind the wall, not wasting a second for whatever that is to see you.

You peek out and stare at it.

It's moved into the light, and now you can get a good look at the thing.

Spike pertrude from every part of the monster.

Drool drips from it's rotten teeth.

It scampers off into the darkness ahead.

You are safe.

For now, at least.
