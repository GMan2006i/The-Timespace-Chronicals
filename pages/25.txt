The monster staggers back and makes a evil shriek of pain.

You move forward quickly, knowing there isn't a moment to lose before the monster gets back up to attack you.

You drive your blade into, what looks like, it's head.

The wound gushes a disgusting gooey liquid.

The monster lets out one final cry, before slumping to the ground, completely lifeless.

You slayed the spiky monster.

You are safe.

For now, at least.
