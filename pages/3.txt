You decide to leave your pen, since it wouldn't seem helpful for snacking.

You walk upstairs and go to the cabinet where the snacks are stored and grab a small bag of chips.

You open the chips, and stuff some in your mouth.

As you are furiously munching on your chips, you realize a suspicous lack of sound in the house.

Normally, your brother is yelling at his friends on his computer while playing games.
And your sister is gossiping way louder then she should, about people at her school.

You think that maybe they aren't home, but you quickly realize that your parents would have told you if they are going anywhere, since it's a saturday.

You also notice that you haven't heard from or seen your parents all day.

You decide it's best not to question it, so you promptly walk back downstairs into your room.
