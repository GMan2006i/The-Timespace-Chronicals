As you go to sit down, you notice your chair is nowhere to be found.

You think to yourself, that it's probably a prank by your sister.
You listen for laughter or shuffling in the room but hear nothing.

You look around the room for your chair, but can't find to anywhere.
You throw your head back and sigh in annoyance, and as you open your eyes after you sigh you see your chair sitting on the ceiling, as if the ground and ceiling flipped.

You look for Duct Tape or anything else holding the chair to the ceiling, but find nothing.
