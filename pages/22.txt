You pull out your trusty pen that you grabbed earlier from your desk.

Turns out it was useful!

(See? I told you!)



You run towards the monster, brandishing the pen.

It throws a punch with it's massive spiked arm, Aiming to impale you!

Quickly, you parry it's attack by grabbing it's hefty arm and driving the pen into the smooth lizard-like skin.

The beast let's out a nasty screech of pain.

You really have seemed to done a number on it!
