Not wasting the opportunity, you dash forward and awkardly kick it in, what seems to be, it's face.

The beast staggers back.

You continue to kick and punch the beast, endlessly beating on it.

After a while of beating up the monster, you grab your pen, ripping it violently out of the beast's arm.

The beast retreats into the darkness, wounded, from your questionable onslaught of attacks.

You are safe.

For now, at least.
