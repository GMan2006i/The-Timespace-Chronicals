You wake up and look around.


You find youself in a dark, dank, concrete room.
Even though there aren't any lights, the room appears dimmly lit.
Above you is a dark abyss of blackness, and it seems to strech infinitely upwards.

To either side of you, are stairs which endlessly seem to go up.
On the level you are on, it reads the number "1".

Unfortunately, the start of the stairs where you are, have been destroyed so you can't reach the stairs.

Seeing no way back up, you look around again, and spot a dark hallway ahead of you.
