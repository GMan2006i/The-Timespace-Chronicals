You take the right path.

Following these creepy halls, you find yourself in a room, which seems to be empty.

Besides of course a singular object laying in the middle of the room.

You have no idea what it could possibly be, but you could probably take it with you.

Judging by the recent events, you question whether or not picking up an unknown object is even remotely safe.
